      <p>My passion for photography started when I was 8 years old. My father taught me everything about the complex analogue world and ever since I cannot live without it.<br><br>

      I have always been pushing boundaries and along with that experimental character, I had the habit of always telling my stories to every listening person.<br><br>

      Language used to be my tool in reaching out to the world. And the world started to reach out to me…I gained my knowledge and experiences through other people’s rough or emotional stories.<br><br>

      I soon noticed that I needed to have an image to support their stories. Because a picture can say more than a thousand words. That’s why I started to use the camera whilst searching the streets for stories.<br><br>

      Why am I only using the analogue technique? It feels pure, I experience the moment that I address a person on the street better when I capture it without looking back for the best result. My focus is always on the human I’m in contact with. Not the camera or the photo. The excitement afterwards of the appearing of the one and only image, is sometimes overwhelming.<br><br>  

      Let’s be clear. In this era, almost every photographer is more an editor or a photo shopper. This makes me realise that you could tell beautiful stories on the basis of a photo, but a self-contained photo can never be a fact or a story.<br><br>

      Nowadays I use photography to tell bigger stories. Most of my projects may look very surrealistic but they will always have a realistic undertone.  
      I am sure that when I blow up my view on something that’s happening in the world, it will get more attention and    will eventually raise more awareness and understanding.<br><br> 

      And in the end my motto is: <br>
      <span style="color: #A90000 font-weight: 500">Nothing is what it seems to be.</span><span style= "color: #03A900; font-weight: 500"> Everything is what it is.</span></p>
